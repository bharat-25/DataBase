SQL 10/7

SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.

CREATE A TABLE QUERY:

CREATE TABLE cities(
name VARCHAR(50),
country VARCHAR(50),
population INTEGER,
area INTEGER
);
TO INSERT INTO THE TABLE QUERY :
INSERT INTO
cities(name,country,population,area)
VALUES ('Delhi', 'India', 16753235, 1484);

TO DELETE SOMETHING FROM THE TABLE :
DELETE FROM cities WHERE name ='Delhi';

TO GET A ROUND OFF VALUE :
SELECT name, population / area AS densities FROM cities;

TO CONCAT TWO COLUMNS AND MAKE THEM IN:
UPPER CASE:
SELECT UPPER (CONCAT(name, ', ' ,
country)) AS location FROM cities;

TO UPDATE A PARTICULAR ROW ENTITY :
UPDATE cities SET name = 'Delhi' WHERE
name = 'Goa';
TO GET PARTICULAR VALUES IN A GIVEN RANGE :
SELECT * FROM cities WHERE area BETWEEN
2000 AND 10000;

TO GET ENTIRE TABLE :
SELECT * FROM cities;

OPERATORS:
SELECT name,population, area  FROM cities WHERE area>2000 AND population>1000000;
SELECT name,population, area  FROM cities WHERE area<2000 OR population<1000000;

TO GET THE AREA LARGER THAN 2000:
SELECT name, area FROM cities WHERE area >=2000;

TO GET THE MINIMUM POPULATION CITY
SELECT * FROM cities WHERE population = (SELECT MIN(population)FROM cities);

TO GET THE MAXIMUM POPULATION CITY
SELECT * FROM cities WHERE population = (SELECT MAX(population)FROM cities);
